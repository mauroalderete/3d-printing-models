This repository stores many 3d printing models that resulted in me utils on many occasions.

## Models to calibrate

A typical issue when I work with a 3d printer is the calibration. Each 3dprinter must be calibrated with specific parameters that change from 3dprinter to another and a filament to another.

The perpendicular between the axis, the temperature, the steps or velocity of his motors, and the material composition of filaments is some parameters to consider.

In general, this calibration consists in printing many models so many times how can to achieve the necessary adjustments.

In this repository, you can find the 3d models to calibrate that I often use along with some comments and tips to get the most out of it.
