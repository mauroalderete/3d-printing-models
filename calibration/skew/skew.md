# Skew

Is a model to calibrate the skew on XY plane of models produced by a 3d printer without perpendicular x and y axis.

The model consits in a squad triangle. You can use it to compare with a squad carpenter to get the offset and calculate the ratio or angle that you model must be fix them.

You can use [gcode-cli](https://github.com/mauroalderete/gcode-cli) to apply the skew correction directly in your gcode files exported.
